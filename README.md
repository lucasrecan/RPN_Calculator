# RPN_Calculator


The project is in Python, using the tkinter library.
When you run main.py, you have the choice between using the stack, the queue and the chained list. Most of the project is based on the stack, and it's the part that is the RPN Calculator. 

*RPN are the initials for Reverse Polish Notation. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation)*
